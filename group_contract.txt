At a minimum, your group contract must address these questions:

GOALS

What are our team goals for this project?
What do we want to accomplish?
What skills do we want to develop or refine?

EXPECTATIONS:

What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
POLICIES & PROCEDURES:

What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?
CONSEQUENCES:

How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
Each member should "sign" (you can just type out your name) at the bottom of the submission.
